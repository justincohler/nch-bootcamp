There are now major labs for the RHEL Section.  If you are new to
Linux or UNIX, then here are some short tutorials that will be
beneficial.

# Tutorials for Newbies

If you’re brand new to UNIX/Linux, go through this short tutorial from
[UC Berkeley](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kevin/unix-tutorial/toc.html).  Skip 
section 6 and section 9.3.

# VIM Tutorial

If you haven’t learned vi or vim, it’s highly recommended that you
do. It’s one of the few editors ALWAYS guaranteed to be installed on a
RHEL system.  [UC Davis](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/UnixAndC/Editors/ViIntro.html) has a short tutorial.

Additionally, on any RHEL system, you can type “vimtutor” (without
quotes) at the command line, and run the VIM tutorial.
