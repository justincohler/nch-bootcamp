###Instructions###
1. Run the following commands on the command line to create a new EAP 6 project in OpenShift:

	```
	rhc app-create labweb jbossews-2.0 -g large 
	```
	* These commands will output the generated credentials and locations for the OpenShift Git repository our application will use. Save this information in a text file for safekeeping.

1. Enter the newly cloned git directory
	```
	cd labweb/ 
	```

1. Connect the starter code on GitHub to the OpenShift repository:
	```
	git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/justincohler/nch-bootcamp.git 
	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master 
	```
	* An editor will ask you to enter a merge message. Enter the following to (w)rite the merge record and (q)uit out of the editor:
		```
		> :wq 
		```

1. Finally, push the starter code to OpenShift: 
	```
	git push
	```

This will output the generated users and passwords for the EAP Admin Console, which you can use to configure persistence in the webapp.
